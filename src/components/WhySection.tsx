              I've been where you are, ambitious, juggling too much, and wondering why good ideas weren't moving forward.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Early in my career, I worked in lean teams where everyone wore multiple hats. I watched smart, capable people struggle because roadmaps were unclear, manual tasks ate up entire days, and execution always felt just out of reach.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Instead of waiting for things to change, I started fixing them myself. I mapped features, built simple systems, and set up workflows that freed up time for actual growth.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              I'm Saksham, and that experience shaped how I work today. Most teams don't need endless hires or bloated processes; they need focus, clarity, and someone who can turn strategy into action.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">
              Now, I partner with SaaS founders, e-commerce brands, agencies, and operations-heavy teams to do exactly that: deliver results without the extra headcount, noise, or wasted time.
